?Growing up in delhi which is also entitled as the most polluted capital in the world, we have a firsthand experience of living essentially in a gas chamber. Hence we are targeting air pollution as  core problem which needs to be dealt with immediate and effective measures.
?The problem exists in the monitoring of air pollution, the government has setup some pollution monitoring stations which give statistics of an average area of 55 sq. Km(approx. For delhi only) which is quite inaccurate and general when it comes to taking effective measures for tackling the problem at hand. 
?Also people don’t know how to prevent pollution, even general measures are not applied instead they aim to make amends AFTER the damage is done.  
People consider air pollution as an EMERGENCY but the quality of air is so poor that it should be considered as URGENCY.
We intend to develop a device with the thought in mind that 
 
“Prevention is better than Cure”.
